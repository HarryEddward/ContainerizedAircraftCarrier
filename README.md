## Simple, fast, secure, and production-ready container orchestrator.

**Skip Kubernetes complexity, Docker Swarm uncertainty, and Nomadâ€™s quirks.** Use Docker as your trusted container manager, and for container resource optimization we use Containerd with optimized and flexible configurations without worrying about many features. Forget about thinking about how to structure your services, just push your docker-compose files directly to the orchestrator, while having secure and optimized connections for all orchestrated nodes.
