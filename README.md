## Simple, fast, secure, and production-ready container orchestrator.

**Forget about Kubernetes configuration nightmares and forget about worrying about Docker Swarm support, or Nomad's non-standard internal processes**. Use Docker as your trusted container manager, and for container resource optimization we use Containerd with optimized and flexible configurations without worrying about many features. Forget about thinking about how to structure your services, just push your docker-compose files directly to the orchestrator, while having secure and optimized connections for all orchestrated nodes.
